This package contains three renderer features: Hi-Z Buffer renderer feature, Color Pyramid renderer feature and SSR renderer feature. Put ALL these three renderer features in the renderer data to make them work.  See the example renderer data asset in Settings folder for a reference.
IMPORTANT NOTE: 1. If you want to make this package work in build, you should add ALL shaders in this package into the "always include in build shaders" list, otherwise Unity will remove them when building player and cause the effect to break.  Go to Edit->Project Settings->Graphics->Always Included Shaders, increase the size of that array and put "Hidden/SSRShader","Hidden/HiZBufferShader","Hidden/ColorPyramidShader","Hidden/DepthPrecisionTest" in.
2. If you want to apply the renderer feature on multiply cameras with the "Physically Based" glossy reflection simulating mode, DO NOT use an exactly same render target profile among different cameras (such as two cameras using the same rendering resolution) otherwise the resource pooling system will reuse the render textures between different cameras instead of creating a new instance and break temporal accumulation logics, causing reflections to be mixed up among cameras.
